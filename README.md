Description
------------------

The *npm-script* allows creating icon fonts from a given set of SVG vector images during the app's build phase. Internally the *npm-script* uses [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and the awesome libraries [gulp-iconfont](https://github.com/nfroidure/gulp-iconfont) (by *Nicolas Froidure*) to generate the SVG/*TTF/EOT/WOFF/WOFF2* fonts.

The *Angular 2* directive **CustomIcon** provides a convenient way to embed the previously generated icon fonts in an *Ionic 2* app by simply adding a component to the HTML template. See the following example:
```html
<custom-icon set="myIconSet" name="myIcon"></custom-icon>
```
A set of *Sass/CSS* rules comes along with directive, which allows adding icons to default  *Ionic 2* components like buttons and list items.

<sub>**Notice:** Please be aware that there are serious reasons to not use icon fonts at all. See [here](https://sarasoueidan.com/blog/icon-fonts-to-svg/#recommended-reading) for further discussions. But as the Ionic 2 team prefers icon fonts over other solutions, this is also the path I have chosen.</sub>
