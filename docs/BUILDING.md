Building the library
====================

There are a only few more steps required if you want to build the library. Please note, that this is not required if you just want to use the library in your *Ionic 2* app.

Make sure that all npm dependencies are installed:
```
npm install
```

Build the library by running the following command:
```
npm run build
```
